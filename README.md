# PhoneDirectory

Implemented Phone Directory using Doubly Linked List.
  LinkedLists are convenient because it is easy and fast to insert and remove frequently modified items from the list. A doubly-linked list is particularly nice because   you can iterate and search from the front (head) of the end of the list or the back (tail).
